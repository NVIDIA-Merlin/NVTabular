Examples
========


We created a collection of Jupyter notebooks based on different datasets. The examples cover how
to use NVTabular in combination with TensorFlow, PyTorch and `HugeCTR <https://github.com/NVIDIA/HugeCTR>`_ .
Each example explains some features of NVTabular in detail. We provide an order to go through the notebooks 
as the later ones expect some prior knowledge.
