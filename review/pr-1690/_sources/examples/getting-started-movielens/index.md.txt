# Getting Started with Movielens

The MovieLens25M is a popular dataset for recommender systems and is used in academic publications.
Most users are familiar with the dataset and the example notebooks teach the basic concepts of NVTabular:

* Learning NVTabular for using GPU-accelerated ETL (Preprocess and Feature Engineering).
* Getting familiar with NVTabularâ€™s high-level API.
* Using single-hot/multi-hot categorical input features with NVTabular.
* Using NVTabular dataloader with TensorFlow Keras model.
* Using NVTabular dataloader with PyTorch.
