Getting Started with Movielens
==============================

The MovieLens25M is a popular dataset for recommender systems and is used in academic publications. Most users are familiar with the dataset and we will teach the basic concepts of NVTabular:

* Learning NVTabular for using GPU-accelerated ETL (Preprocess and Feature Engineering)
* Getting familiar with NVTabular's high-level API
* Using single-hot/multi-hot categorical input features with NVTabular
* Using NVTabular dataloader with TensorFlow Keras model
* Using NVTabular dataloader with PyTorch
