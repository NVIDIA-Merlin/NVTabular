class Clip(Operator):
    """
    This operation clips continuous values so that they are within a min/max bound.
    For instance by setting the min value to 0, you can replace all negative values with 0.
    This is helpful in cases where you want to log normalize values::

        # clip all continuous columns to be positive only, and then take the log of the clipped
        # columns
        columns = ColumnSelector(CONT_NAMES) >> Clip(min_value=0) >> LogOp()

    Parameters
    ----------
    min_value : float, default None
        The minimum value to clip values to: values less than this will be replaced with
        this value. Specifying ``None`` means don't apply a minimum threshold.
    max_value : float, default None
        The maximum value to clip values to: values greater than this will be replaced with
        this value. Specifying ``None`` means don't apply a maximum threshold.
