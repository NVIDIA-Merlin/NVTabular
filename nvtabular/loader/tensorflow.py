class KerasSequenceLoader(tf.keras.utils.Sequence, DataLoader):
    """
    Infinite generator used to asynchronously iterate through CSV or Parquet
    dataframes on GPU by leveraging an NVTabular `Dataset`. Applies preprocessing
    via NVTabular `Workflow` objects and outputs tabular dictionaries of TensorFlow
    Tensors via `dlpack <https://github.com/dmlc/dlpack>`_. Useful for training tabular models
    built in Keras and trained via
    `tf.keras.Model.fit <https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/Model>`_.

    The data loading scheme is implemented by loading, preprocessing, and
    batching data in an asynchronous thread. The amount of randomness in
    shuffling is controlled by the `buffer_size` and `parts_per_chunk`
    kwargs. At load time, sub-chunks of data with size controlled by
    `buffer_size` are loaded from random partitions in the dataset,
    and `parts_per_chunk` of them are concatenated into a single chunk,
    shuffled, and split into batches. This means that each chunk has
    `buffer_size*parts_per_chunk` rows, and due to the asynchronous
    nature of the dataloader that means there are, including the batch
    being processed by your network, `3*buffer_size*parts_per_chunk`
    rows of data in GPU memory at any given time. This means that
    for a fixed memory budget, using more `parts_per_chunk` will
    come at the expense of smaller `buffer_size`, increasing the number
    of reads and reducing throughput. The goal should be to maximize the
    total amount of memory utilized at once without going OOM and with
    the fewest number of reads to meet your epoch-level randomness needs.

    An important thing to note is that TensorFlow's default behavior
    is to claim all GPU memory for itself at initialziation time,
    which leaves none for NVTabular to load or preprocess data.
    As such, we attempt to configure TensorFlow to restrict
    its memory allocation on a given GPU using the environment variables
    `TF_MEMORY_ALLOCATION` and `TF_VISIBLE_DEVICE`. If `TF_MEMORY_ALLOCATION < 1`,
    it will be assumed that this refers to a fraction of free GPU
    memory on the given device. Otherwise, it will refer to an explicit
    allocation amount in MB. `TF_VISIBLE_DEVICE` should be an integer GPU
    index.

    Iterator output is of the form `(dict(features), list(labels))`,
    where each element of the features dict is a
    `feature_name: feature_tensor`  and each elemtn of the labels
    list is a tensor, and all tensors are of shape `(batch_size, 1)`.
    Note that this means vectorized continuous and multi-hot categorical
    features are not currently supported.
    The underlying NVTabular `Dataset` object is stored in the `data`
    attribute, and should be used for updating NVTabular `Workflow`
    statistics::

        workflow = nvt.Workflow(...)
        dataset = KerasSequenceLoader(...)
        workflow.update_stats(dataset.data.to_iter(), record_stats=True)

    Parameters
    -------------
    - paths_or_dataset: str or list(str)
        Either a string representing a file pattern (see `tf.glob` for
        pattern rules), a list of filenames to be iterated through, or
        a Dataset object, in which case `buffer_size`, `engine`, and
        `reader_kwargs` will be ignored
    - batch_size: int
        Number of samples to yield at each iteration
    - label_names: list(str)
        Column name of the target variable in the dataframe specified by
        `paths_or_dataset`
    - feature_columns: list(tf.feature_column) or None
        A list of TensorFlow feature columns representing the inputs
        exposed to the model to be trained. Columns with parent columns
        will climb the parent tree, and the names of the columns in the
        unique set of terminal columns will be used as the column names.
        If left as None, must specify `cat_names` and `cont_names`
    - cat_names: list(str) or None
        List of categorical column names. Ignored if `feature_columns` is
        specified
    - cont_names: list(str) or None
        List of continuous column names. Ignored if `feature_columns` is
        specified
    - engine: {'csv', 'parquet', None}, default None
        String specifying the type of read engine to use. If left as `None`,
        will try to infer the engine type from the file extension.
    - shuffle: bool, default True
        Whether to shuffle chunks of batches before iterating through them.
    - buffer_size: float or int
        If `0 <  buffer_size < 1`, `buffer_size` will refer to the fraction of
        total GPU memory to occupy with a buffered chunk. If `1 < buffer_size <
        batch_size`, the number of rows read for a buffered chunk will
        be equal to `int(buffer_size*batch_size)`. Otherwise, if `buffer_size >
        batch_size`, `buffer_size` rows will be read in each chunk (except for
        the last chunk in a dataset, which will, in general, be smaller).
        Larger chunk sizes will lead to more efficieny and randomness,
        but require more memory.
    - workflows: list(nvtabular.Workflow)
        `nvtabular.Workflow`s for applying online preprocessing. Must
        be consistent with the dataset schema specified by `feature_columns`
        or `cat_names` and `cont_names`
    - devices: None
        Which GPU devices to load from. Ignored for now
    - parts_per_chunk: int
        Number of dataset partitions with size dictated by `buffer_size`
        to load and concatenate asynchronously. More partitions leads to
        better epoch-level randomness but can negatively impact throughput
    - reader_kwargs: dict
        extra kwargs to pass when instantiating the underlying
        `nvtabular.Dataset`
