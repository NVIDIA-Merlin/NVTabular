Advanced Ops with Outbrain
==========================

`Outbrain dataset <https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction>`_ is based on a Kaggle Competition in which Kagglers were challenged to predict on which ads and other forms of sponsored content its global users would click. We will teach to use more of the available NVTabular operators:

* Getting familiar with a wide range of NVTabular operators
* Writing a custom operator
* Training Wide&Deep model with NVTabular dataloader in TensorFlow
