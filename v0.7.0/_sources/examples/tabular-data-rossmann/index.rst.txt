===============================================================

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores are provided. The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Kaggle hosted it as a 
`competition <https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/overview>`_. These notebooks show how
