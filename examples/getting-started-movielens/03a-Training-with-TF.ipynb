    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We observed that TensorFlow training pipelines can be slow as the dataloader is a bottleneck. The native dataloader in TensorFlow randomly sample each item from the dataset, which is very slow. The window dataloader in TensorFlow is not much faster. In our experiments, we are able to speed-up existing TensorFlow pipelines by 9x using a highly optimized dataloader.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying deep learning models to recommendation systems faces unique challenges in comparison to other domains, such as computer vision and natural language processing. The datasets and common model architectures have unique characteristics, which require custom solutions. Recommendation system datasets have terra-bytes in size with billion examples but each example is represented by only a few bytes. For example, the [Criteo CTR dataset](https://ailab.criteo.com/download-criteo-1tb-click-logs-dataset/), the largest publicly available dataset, is 1.3TB with 4 billion examples. The model architectures have normally large embedding tables for the users and items, which do not fit on a single GPU.

    "### MovieLens25M\n",
    "\n",
    "The [MovieLens25M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) is a popular dataset for recommender systems and is used in academic publications. The dataset contains 25M movie ratings for 62,000 movies given by 162,000 users. Many projects use only the user/item/rating information of MovieLens, but the original dataset provides metadata for the movies, as well. For example, which genres a movie has. Although we may not improve state-of-the-art results with our neural network architecture, the purpose of this notebook is to explain how to integrate multi-hot categorical features into a neural network."
