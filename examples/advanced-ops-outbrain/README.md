# Advanced Ops with Outbrain

The [Outbrain click prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/outbrain-click-prediction) is based on a Kaggle competition in which Kagglers were challenged to predict which ads and other forms of sponsored content its global users would click.
We can use the dataset to learn more about the NVTabular operators:

- Become familiar with a wide range of NVTabular operators.
- Write a custom operator.
- Train a wide and deep model with NVTabular dataloader in TensorFlow.
