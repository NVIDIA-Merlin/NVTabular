    "# Training Tabular Deep Learning Models with Keras on GPU\n",
    "Deep learning has revolutionized the fields of computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) in the last few years, providing a fast and general framework for solving a host of difficult problems with unprecedented accuracy. Part and parcel of this revolution has been the development of APIs like [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) for NVIDIA GPUs, allowing practitioners to quickly iterate on new and interesting ideas and receive feedback on their efficacy in shorter and shorter intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "One class of problem which has remained largely immune to this revolution, however, is the class involving tabular data. Part of this difficulty is that, unlike CV or NLP, where different datasets are underlied by similar phenomena and therefore can be solved with similar mechanisms, \"tabular datasets\" span a vast array of phenomena, semantic meanings, and problem statements, from product and video recommendation to particle discovery and loan default prediction. This diversity makes universally useful components difficult to find or even define, and is only exacerbated by the notorious lack of standard, industrial-scale benchmark datasets in the tabular space. Accordingly, deep learning models are frequently bested by their machine learning analogues on these important tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet this diversity is also what makes tools like Keras all the more valuable. Architecture components can be quickly swapped in and out for different tasks like the implementation details they are, and new components can be built and tested with ease. Importantly, domain experts can interact with models at a high level and build their expertise into their design, without having to spend their time becoming Python programming wizrds. However, the other key ingredient of fast feedback, enabled by GPU acceleration and correlating with cost-efficiency for production pipelines, is lacking in most out-of-the-box APIs. In this example, we will walk through some recent advancements made by NVIDIA's [NVTabular](https://github.com/nvidia/nvtabular) library that can alleviate existing bottlenecks and bring to bear the full power of GPU acceleration."
