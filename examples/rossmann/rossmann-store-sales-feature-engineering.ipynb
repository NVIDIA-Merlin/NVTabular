    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "NVTabular is a feature engineering and preprocessing library for tabular data designed to quickly and easily manipulate terabyte scale datasets used to train deep learning based recommender systems.  It provides a high level abstraction to simplify code and accelerates computation on the GPU using the RAPIDS cuDF library."

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the steps for carrying out data preprocessing, transformation and loading with NVTabular on the Kaggle Rossmann [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/overview).  Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores are provided. The task is to forecast the \"Sales\" column for the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following example will illustrate how to use NVTabular to preprocess and feature engineer the data for futher training deep learning models. We provide notebooks for training neural networks in [TensorFlow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular/blob/main/examples/rossmann/rossmann-store-sales-tensorflow.ipynb), [PyTorch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular/blob/main/examples/rossmann/rossmann-store-sales-pytorch.ipynb) and [FastAI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular/blob/main/examples/rossmann/rossmann-store-sales-fastai.ipynb). We'll use a [dataset built by FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson6-rossmann.ipynb) for solving the [Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). Some cuDF preprocessing is required to build the appropriate feature set, so make sure to run [rossmann-store-sales-preproc.ipynb](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NVTabular/blob/main/examples/rossmann/rossmann-store-sales-preproc.ipynb) first before going through this notebook."

For example, the `Normalize` op requires measurements of the dataset mean and standard deviation, and the `Categorify` op requires an accounting of all the categories a particular feature can manifest. However, we frequently need to measure these properties across datasets which are too large to fit into GPU memory (or CPU memory for that matter) at once.\n",

Under the hood, the data decomposition corresponds to the construction of a [dask_cudf.DataFrame](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/dask-cudf.html) object.  By representing our dataset as a lazily-evaluated [Dask](https://dask.org/) collection, we can handle the calculation of complex global statistics (and later, can also iterate over the partitions while feeding data into a neural network).\n",
