    "# nvTabular demo on Rossmann data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "nvTabular is a feature engineering and preprocessing library for tabular data designed to quickly and easily manipulate terabyte scale datasets used to train deep learning based recommender systems.  It provides a high level abstraction to simplify code and accelerates computation on the GPU using the RAPIDS cuDF library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the steps for carrying out data preprocessing, transformation and loading with NVTabular on the Kaggle Rossmann [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/overview).  Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores are provided. The task is to forecast the \"Sales\" column for the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following example will illustrate how to use NVTabular to preprocess and load tabular data for training neural networks in both PyTorch and TensorFlow. We'll use a [dataset built by FastAI](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl1/lesson3-rossman.ipynb) for solving the [Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). Some pandas preprocessing is required to build the appropriate feature set, so make sure to run [rossmann-store-sales-preproc.ipynb](./rossmann-store-sales-preproc.ipynb) first before going through this notebook."
