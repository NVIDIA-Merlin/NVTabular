# Multi-GPU Example Notebooks

The following notebooks demonstrate how to perform multi-GPU training with NVTabluar, TensorFlow, and PyTorch:

- [Training with TensorFlow on MovieLens Data](01-03-MultiGPU-Download-Convert-ETL-with-NVTabular-Training-with-TensorFlow.ipynb)
- [Training with PyTorch on MovieLens Data](01-03-MultiGPU-Download-Convert-ETL-with-NVTabular-Training-with-PyTorch.ipynb)
- [Learn about NVTabular and Dask](../multi-gpu-toy-example/multi-gpu_dask.ipynb)

See the [examples/multi-gpu-movielens](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Merlin/NVTabular/tree/main/examples/multi-gpu-movielens)
