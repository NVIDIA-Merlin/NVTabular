    "# Multi-GPU with MovieLens: ETL and Training \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA Merlin is a open source framework to accelerate and scale end-to-end recommender system pipelines on GPU. In this notebook, we use NVTabular, Merlin’s ETL component, to scale feature engineering and pre-processing to multiple GPUs and then perform data-parallel distributed training of a neural network on multiple GPUs with PyTorch, [Horovod](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), and [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pre-requisites for this notebook are to be familiar with NVTabular and its API:\n",
    "- You can read more about NVTabular, its API and specialized dataloaders in [Getting Started with Movielens notebooks](../getting-started-movielens).\n",
    "- You can read more about scaling NVTabular ETL in [Scaling Criteo notebooks](../scaling-criteo).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this notebook, we will focus only on the new information related to multi-GPU training, so please check out the other notebooks first (if you haven’t already.)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we learn how to scale ETL and deep learning taining to multiple GPUs\n",
    "- Learn to use larger than GPU/host memory datasets for ETL and training\n",
    "- Use multi-GPU or multi node for ETL with NVTabular\n",
    "- Use NVTabular dataloader to accelerate PyTorch pipelines\n",
    "- Scale PyTorch training with Horovod\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use the [MovieLens25M](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) dataset. It is popular for recommender systems and is used in academic publications. The dataset contains 25M movie ratings for 62,000 movies given by 162,000 users. Many projects use only the user/item/rating information of MovieLens, but the original dataset provides metadata for the movies, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We are using the MovieLens 25M dataset in this example for simplicity, although the dataset is not large enough to require multi-GPU training. However, the functionality demonstrated in this notebook can be easily extended to scale recommender pipelines for larger datasets in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Horovod](https://horovod.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a distributed deep learning framework that provides tools for multi-GPU optimization.\n",
    "- The [NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL)](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl) provides the underlying GPU-based implementations of the [allgather](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/usage/operations.html#allgather) and [allreduce](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/usage/operations.html#allreduce) cross-GPU communication operations."
