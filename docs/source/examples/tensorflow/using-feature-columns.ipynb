    "# NVTabular with TensorFlow Feature Columns\n",
    "We'll be basing this example off of [TensorFlow's structured data tutorial](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/tutorials/structured_data/feature_columns.ipynb), but we'll show how to move all of its functionality onto the GPU, and even make it robust to larger and more complex use cases (where GPU acceleration will be more pronounced). Let's begin by starting the same way: doing our imports and downloading the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## VERY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE\n",
    "Using NVTabular for TensorFlow data loading requires saving some GPU memory for use by the libraries NVT wraps around, namely CuDF. This is slightly non-trivial, since TensorFlow's default behavior is to grab all of the GPU's memory for itself as soon as its context is initialized. In order to ensure this doesn't happen, make sure to set the `TF_MEMORY_ALLOCATION` environment variable up front to the fraction of GPU memory you would like to reserver for TensorFlow and then import the `KerasSequenceLoader` before you do _anything_ with TensorFlow. NVTabular will use that environment variable to properly configure TF to use the memory fraction you dictate (you can also explicitly specify a MB allocation as well)."

At this step, we create ColumnGroups, a group of columns that you want to apply the same transformations to, for our categorical, continuous and label features.

    "Except that's still not quite it, because the actual implementation of these online transformations is really suboptimal on GPU for reasons that I go over in excruciating detail in the [_accelerating-tensorflow_](./accelerating_tensorflow.ipynb) notebook. Which is too bad, not only because feature columns are a convenient input representation, but also because if you're a seasoned TF user for tabular data, you probably already have these set up! The last thing I want to make you do is rewrite a bunch of code you've spent months getting together.\n",

    "That's why NVTabular provides a utility `make_feature_column_workflow` which will read through all the feature columns you use, figure out what online preprocessing steps they apply, the recreate them with an equivalent NVTabular `Workflow` that can be mapped on to the `KerasSequenceLoader` we use to load our data in order to be applied online! It will even return a simplified set of feature columns which represent all of the outputs from that `Workflow`. These can be used to instantiate the Keras `DenseFeatures` layer or, even better, since NVTabular is now handling all the online preprocessing, you can use another utility provided by NVTabular, the `ScalarDenseFeatures` layer, to map from these tensors to a dense network input!"

    "The last difference here is that since our `KerasSequenceLoader` returns a `dict` of `{tensor_name: tensor}` pairs, we can't use the `tf.keras.Sequential` object like the original notebook does. Instead, we'll just explicitly create the input tensors using our simplified feature columns then chain the layers together manually. This Keras Functional API approach is much more flexible, and enables the use of models that don't have straightforward, linear paths through them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that rather than pass `val_ds` to the `validation_data` kwarg of `model.fit`, we pass the `KerasSequenceValidater` to the `callbacks` kwarg. The reason for this is that Keras doesn't support its `Sequence` object (from which `KerasSequenceLoader` inherits) as validation data, which complicates the picture for validation datasets that can't fit into memory. This custom callback takes care of calculating online validation metrics and passing them to the model's logs to be fed to downstream callbacks like the print logger. As such, it's always good practice to put it first in your `callbacks` list if you have others that rely on validation metric information (e.g. early stopping or learning rate decay)."
